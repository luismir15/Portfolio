                <p>Since an early age I have always been facinated with the world of 
                technology. From video games to computer and now smart phones! Now with
                21 year of age I'm interested in any type of software development. Currently 
                I'm pursing a bachelor degree in Computer Science at Florida International 
                University. In my free time I enjoy playing video game, taking pictures of 
                my dog and posting projects/tutorials on GitHub.
